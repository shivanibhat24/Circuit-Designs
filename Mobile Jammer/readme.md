## ‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Explanation  
1. **RF Amplifier**  
   - The resistor, transistor, and capacitors connected at the base and collector of the NPN transistor form an RF amplifier.  
   - Capacitors generate the noise signal.  

2. **Output**  
   - The noise signal output is taken across the **2.2pF capacitor**.  

3. **Tuning Oscillator**  
   - A **22nH inductor** and **15pF capacitor** form a parallel tuning oscillator circuit to generate noise in the telecom frequency band.

4. **Power Supply**  
   - A 4‚Äì5V power source is required for proper operation.  

5. **Oscilloscope Observation**  
   - The output waveform on the oscilloscope shows noise in the telecom band, appearing as a distorted and variable waveform.

## üìä Output Waveform  
The oscilloscope captures the noise signal as a distorted, variable waveform that interferes with communication in the telecom band.

## üß© Future Enhancements  
- Test noise generation at multiple frequency bands.  
- Implement a programmable noise generator for adjustable frequency bands.
